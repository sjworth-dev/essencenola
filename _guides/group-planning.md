Essence Festival isn't just a concert—it's a homecoming. Four days of music, empowerment, culture, and community. Bringing your squad means sharing that experience together. Here's how to coordinate your group for an unforgettable weekend.

---

## Why Bring Your Squad

- **Shared experience** — Essence hits different when you're with your people
- **Split costs** — Private houses mean more space for less money
- **Safety and support** — Navigate the weekend together
- **Maximize the experience** — Split up for seminars, reunite for concerts
- **Memories for life** — These are the trips you'll talk about forever

---

## Step 1: Know the Festival

### Essence Fest 2026

**Dates:** July 2-5, 2026 (Thursday-Sunday)

**Two Main Components:**

| Venue | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Superdome | Nightly concerts | Fri, Sat, Sun nights (7pm-late) |
| Convention Center | Empowerment seminars, marketplace, daytime events | Thurs-Sun (10am-6pm) |

### The Daily Structure

**Daytime (Convention Center):**
- Free admission
- Empowerment Experience: panels, speakers, wellness
- Marketplace: Black-owned vendors
- Beauty & style experiences
- Meet and greets

**Nighttime (Superdome):**
- Ticketed concerts
- Major R&B, hip-hop, gospel headliners
- Three nights of performances
- Each night is different artists

---

## Step 2: Tickets Strategy

### Superdome Concert Tickets

| Type | Approx. Price | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Single night | $150-250 | Pick your headliners |
| 3-night package | $400-600 | All three concert nights |
| VIP/Premium | $800+ | Better seating, perks |

**Buy early.** Essence sells out. Prices increase as the date approaches.

### Convention Center

**Free.** Register online for the Empowerment Experience but no ticket needed.

### Group Ticket Buying

**Option 1:** Everyone buys their own
- Simple
- People can choose their nights
- May end up in different sections

**Option 2:** One person buys all tickets together
- Same section, sit together
- Requires upfront coordination
- Collect money first

**Recommendation:** Buy as a group if you want to sit together. The Superdome is massive—being separated isn't ideal.

## Step 3: Accommodations

### Why Private Houses

During Essence weekend:

| Factor | Private House | Hotel |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Space for 15 | One property | 7-8 rooms, scattered |
| Morning recovery | Pool, kitchen, space | Cramped room |
| Pre-concert prep | Full house to get ready | Hotel bathroom |
| Price per person | $150-300/night | $350-500/night |
| Vibes | Your own space | Hotel crowds |

### Book EARLY

Essence is one of the biggest events in New Orleans. Properties book 6-12 months out.

| Timing | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| 9-12 months before | Best selection, best prices |
| 6-9 months before | Good options remain |
| 3-6 months before | Slim pickings |
| Last minute | You'll pay double or more |

### Location Priorities

**Best for Essence:**
1. **CBD/Warehouse District** — Walking distance to Superdome and Convention Center
2. **French Quarter** — Close to everything, Uber short
3. **Marigny/Bywater** — Fun neighborhoods, 10-15 min to venues

**Avoid:** Anything requiring 30+ min transport to downtown.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Squad Systems

### Communication

Create your group chat **6+ months before.** Use:
- WhatsApp (best for polls and mixed phone types)
- iMessage (if everyone has iPhones)
- GroupMe

**Pin essential info:**
- House address
- Ticket confirmation numbers
- Reservation details

### Money Management

**Use Splitwise.** It tracks:
- Who paid for what
- Who owes whom
- Running totals

Add every expense. Settle up regularly—don't wait until the end.

### Payment Schedule

| Payment | When | Amount |
|---------|------|--------|
| Deposit | At commitment | $200-250 |
| Concert tickets | When purchased | Ticket cost |
| Housing balance | 2 months before | Remaining housing |
| Activity fund | 2 weeks before | $100 for shared supplies |

---

## Step 5: Assign Squad Roles

### The Key Players

**The Coordinator**
- Books the house
- Manages the money
- Creates the master schedule
- Makes final decisions

**The Advance Team (2-3 people)**
- Arrives early

**The Event Captain**

**The Glam Captain**

**The Navigator**

---

## Step 6: The Money Breakdown

### Sample Budget (15 people, 4 nights)

| Expense | Total | Per Person |
|---------|-------|------------|
| House rental | $6,000 | $400 |
| Concert tickets (3 nights) | $8,250 | $550 |
| Groceries/supplies | $600 | $40 |
| Group dinner | $1,200 | $80 |

### The Getting Ready Situation

With 10-15 people and limited bathrooms, you need a system:

**Bathroom Rotation:**
- Create time slots (45 min each)
- Start early (4-5pm for 9pm departure)
- Showers first, then makeup stations elsewhere

**Glam Setup:**
- Designate makeup/hair stations in bedrooms
- Bring ring lights and mirrors
- Create a playlist for getting ready

**The 2-Hour Rule:** Whatever time you think you need, add 2 hours.

---

## Step 8: Transportation

### Getting to New Orleans

**Louis Armstrong Airport (MSY):** 30-40 min from downtown

**From Airport:**
- Uber/Lyft: $30-45
- Uber XL (6 people): $40-55
- Coordinate arrivals to share rides

### Getting Around During Essence

**To Convention Center/Superdome:**
- Walk if you're in CBD (best)
- Uber (expect surge pricing at concert end)
- Rideshare after concerts is CHAOS—be patient

**Pro Tips:**
- Leave concerts 15 min early to beat the Uber rush
- Set pickup points away from main exits
- Or walk back if you're close enough

**For Day Parties:**
- Uber is fine during daytime
- One person books all rides, Splitwise after

---

## Step 9: Day Parties & Events

Beyond the official festival, Essence weekend has countless day parties, brunches, and events.

### Types of Events

| Event Type | Vibe | Price |
|------------|------|-------|
| Day parties | Pool parties, DJ sets, dancing | $50-150 |
| Brunches | Bottomless, themed, celebrity hosts | $75-200 |
| After parties | Late night, club events | $50-100 |
| Meet & greets | Celebrity appearances | Varies |

### How to Find Them

- Follow @essencefest on socials
- Check Eventbrite for Essence weekend
- Follow promoters and influencers

### Group Strategy

Not everyone wants to do every event. Plan:
